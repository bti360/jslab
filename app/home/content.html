<h1>JS Lab</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the BTI360 JavaScript Lab. This is meant to serve as both an introduction for developers new to JavaScript and a refresher for experienced JavaScript developers.
</p>

<p>
  This content of this application will guide you through various parts of JavaScript development, from vanilla JS to AngularJS. Each page has code examples, helpful tips and warnings that we've gathered over the years and a live coding section. In the right colum of each page, there is example code in an embedded editor from <a href="http://cssdeck.com">CSSDeck</a>. You can edit the code in the editor and the output will automatically display the resulting page.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, this application is built using AngularJS and is completely open source. Feel free to browse through the code on Github using the provided button. We hope that the code of this application can show you some best practices for creating Angular apps, including several other tools such as GulpJS, SCSS, Live Reload, JSHint, JSCS and Github Pages. We intend for this application to be updated periodically as new concepts are introduced. So, if you notice any issues or have any suggestions for how we can improve anything, please let us know by opening an issue on Github.
