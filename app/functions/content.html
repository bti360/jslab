<h1>Functions</h1>

<p>
	Understanding JavaScript functions, and the many ways they can be used, is one of the best ways to get your JS skills 
	to the next level.
</p>

<p>
	There are a few different ways that you can define functions. We'll start with the simplest to understand, the regular
	function declaration:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
function add(x) {
  return 4 + x;
}
</pre>

<p>
	We can call "add" elsewhere in our script with a single argument:
</p>

<pre>
	add(3);
</pre>

<p>
	This form of method declaration is usually best used in situations where you want to break up a larger function's
	internals into separate private functions that won't be reused again:
<p>

<pre class="code-example">
function doALotOfThings() {
  doA();
  doB();

  function doA() {
    // code for doing 'A'
  }

  function doB() {
    // code for doing 'B'
  }

}
</pre>

	Defining functions like this at the top level of a file or script block (i.e. not in an object or within another 
	function) will put the function under the global scope, which we generally want to avoid.

<p>
	The second way of declaring a function is on an object. This type of function is typically called a "method":
<p>

<pre class="code-example">
var math = {
  add: function(x) {
    return 4 + x;
  }
};
</pre>

<p>
	You'll find yourself declaring functions in this fashion often, since you'll either want to call a method on an
	object or namespace functions so that they don't sit direction under the global namespace. To call the method above,
	we execute it like so:
</p>

<pre>
	math.add(3);
</pre>

<p>
	The third way of declaring functions involves creating contructor functions. These functions allow us to create
	and initialize JavaScript objects:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
function Animal(name, type) {
  this.name = name;
  this.type = type;

  this.sayHi = function() {
    return "Hi, I'm " + this.name + " the " + this.type;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
	Using this function, we can create Animal objects and use their methods to act on them. Constructors are special in 
	that you have to call it using the <code>new</code> keyword:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
var dumbo = new Animal("dumbo", "elephant");
dumbo.sayHi();
</pre>

<jslab-warning>
	Forgetting the <code>new</code> keyword can result in creating an object where the <code>this</code> is bound to the
	global scope <code>window</code> instead of a new object's scope. Make sure to always use <code>new</code>!
