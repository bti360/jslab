<h1>Objects</h1>

<p>
	JavaScript objects are a structure made up of key/value pairs. The keys are strings, and the values can be any 
	JavaScript value or object, including functions. Here is the simplest way to create an object:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
var obj = {};
</pre>

<p>This creates an empty object with default object properties. Let's look at a more interesting example:</p>

<pre class="code-example">
var obj = {
  "name": "Js Lab",
  "numberOfChapters": 6,
  "getAuthors": function() {
    return "Ryan Brady & Kyle Roberts"
  }
};
</pre>

<p>
	The object above contains three properties of different types. We can read any of these properties by calling the
	property on the object using either dot notation or bracket notation:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
obj.name;
obj['name'];

obj.numberOfChapters;
obj['numberOfChapters'];

obj.getAuthors();
obj['getAuthors']();
</pre>

<p>
	The dot notation is usually preferable due to its better readability, but the bracket notation can be useful if we're
	calling the property with a variable string.
