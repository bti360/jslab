<h3>Creating Objects</h3>

<p>
	JavaScript objects are a structure made up of key/value pairs. The keys are strings, and the values can be any 
	JavaScript value or object, including functions. Here is the simplest way to create an object:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
var obj = {};
</pre>

<p>This creates an empty object with default object properties. Let's look at a more interesting example:</p>

<pre class="code-example">
var obj = {
  "name": "Js Lab",
  "numberOfChapters": 6,
  "getAuthors": function() {
    return "Ryan Brady &amp; Kyle Roberts"
  }
};
</pre>

<p>
	The object above contains three properties of different types. We can read any of these properties by calling the
	property on the object using either dot notation or bracket notation:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
obj.name;
obj['name'];

obj.numberOfChapters;
obj['numberOfChapters'];

obj.getAuthors();
obj['getAuthors']();
</pre>

<p>
	The dot notation is usually preferable due to its better readability, but the bracket notation can be useful if we're
	calling the property with a variable string.
</p>

<p>
	Objects can also be created by defining a function and then calling that function with the <code>new</code> keyword.
	These types of functions are called constructor functions. The first letter of the function is typically capitalized
	to denote that they are constructors:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
function Animal() {
  // initialization code
}
var a = new Animal();   // creates a new Animal object
</pre>

<p>
	While the object literal notation is useful for creating quick one-off objects, it's not as easy to use when dealing 
	with behaviors or inheritance. In general, use literals when you need to pass a map of information (and simple 
	behaviors) between functions, and constructor functions when you need to model anything more complicated.
</p>

<jslab-warning>
	Built-in JS objects should rarely be called with the <code>new</code> keyword. See the <a ui-sref="gotchas" 
	title="Gotchas">Gotchas</a> 
	section for more info.

	<h3>Namespaces and Modules</h3>
	<p>
		JavaScript doesn't have a built-in notion of namespaces or packages, but we can use regular JS objects as an implementation. By default, any function or variable defined at the top-level of a file will be placed under the global
		namespace object <code>window</code>. We want to avoid adding everything directly to this object because it adds the
		possibility for name clashes, global state, and other issues. Instead we want to add a top-level namespace object to window, and add any objects or functions underneath.
	</p>

	<jslab-tip>
		You've seen examples of a namespace object if you've used common JS libraries like <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> or <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a>. Both of these libraries define global objects under window
		(<a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/jquery.js#L34">$</a> and <a href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-10">_</a> respectively) that contain the library's objects and functions. 
	</jslab-tip>

	<p>
		The easiest way to create a namespace is to create an object on <code>window</code> or at the top level of a file 
		(which will automatically create the object under <code>window</code>):
	</p>
<pre class="code-example">window.BTI360 = {};
// or
BTI360 = {};</pre>
	
	<p>
		Now we have a namespace that we can create other objects under that namespace:
	</p>

<pre class="code-example">BTI360.MyObj = {};
BTI360.AnotherObj = {
  myFunction: function() {}
};</pre>

<p>
	While namespacing like above can work for smaller projects, a more scalable approach to group your code is to use a module system such as <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>. <a href="">Why AMD</a> and <a href="http://blog.millermedeiros.com/namespaces-are-old-school/">Namespaces are Old School</a> do an excellent job of describing why
	module systems are a better solution than object namespacing. Using RequireJS, our previous namespaced code would look like the following module definitions:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">// Inside file bti360/MyObj.js
define({
  // property list
});

// Inside file bti360/AnotherObj.js
define(['./MyObj'], {  // depends on MyObj
  myFunction: function() {}
});
</pre>

<p>
	Now we have our code separated into modules under their own namespaced files, without the possibility of name clashing
	or overwriting variables/methods.
</p>
