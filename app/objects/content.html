<h1>Objects</h1>

<p>
	JavaScript objects are a structure made up of key/value pairs. The keys are strings, and the values can be any 
	JavaScript value or object, including functions. Here is the simplest way to create an object:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
var obj = {};
</pre>

<p>This creates an empty object with default object properties. Let's look at a more interesting example:</p>

<pre class="code-example">
var obj = {
  "name": "Js Lab",
  "numberOfChapters": 6,
  "getAuthors": function() {
    return "Ryan Brady & Kyle Roberts"
  }
};
</pre>

<p>
	The object above contains three properties of different types. We can read any of these properties by calling the
	property on the object using either dot notation or bracket notation:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
obj.name;
obj['name'];

obj.numberOfChapters;
obj['numberOfChapters'];

obj.getAuthors();
obj['getAuthors']();
</pre>

<p>
	The dot notation is usually preferable due to its better readability, but the bracket notation can be useful if we're
	calling the property with a variable string.
</p>

<p>
	Objects can also be created by defining a function and then calling that function with the <code>new</code> keyword.
	These types of functions are called constructor functions. The first letter of the function is typically capitalized
	to denote that they are constructors:
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
function Animal() {
  // initialization code
}
var a = new Animal();   // creates a new Animal object
</pre>

<p>
	While the object literal notation is useful for creating quick one-off objects, it's not as easy to use when dealing 
	with behaviors or inheritance. In general, use literals when you need to pass a map of information (and simple 
	behaviors) between functions, and constructor functions when you need to model anything more complicated.
</p>

<jslab-warning>
	Built-in JS objects should rarely be called with the <code>new</code> keyword. See the <a href="#/gotchas">Gotchas</a> 
	section for more info.
