<h1>Angular Services</h1>

<p>
  Angular <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services">services</a> are used for code reuse and integration with external services, such as REST APIs and third-party libraries. Confusingly, there are three types of services in Angular, services, factories and providers. To simplify things, we suggest always using the factory type. Services are created using the <code>.factory(name, [dependencies, function()])</code> function on the Angular module object.
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
// mymodule-service.js
// Retrieve previously created module and create service
angular.module('myModule')
.factory('MyService', ['$http', '$log',
  function($http, $log) {
    'use strict';
    
    // Return factory object containing functions that are exposed on the service
    return {
      getFile: function(name) {
        return $http.get('file/' + name);
      },
      sendFile: function(name, file) {
        return $http.post('file/' + name, file);
      }
    };
  }
]);
</pre>

<jslab-tip>
  Services are singletons that are lazily instantiated. This means that your application will only load the service when it's needed and will always return the same service every time. It's a good idea to wrap third-party libraries, such as <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> or <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>, in a service to enable easy mocking for testing and easy migration to other libraries in the future.
