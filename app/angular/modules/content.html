<h1>Angular Modules</h1>

<p>
  Angular applications use a module system to contain the different components of the application. The module system allows for both dependency injection and the single responsibility pattern of each component in a separate file.
</p>

<p>
  Angular modules are defined using the <code>angular.module(name, [dependencies])</code> function. There are two ways to call this function. When the second parameter (dependencies) is passed to the function, it works as a setter function to create an Angular module. When the dependencies are omitted, the function works as a getter function to retrieve an existing Angular module.
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
// Create module named myModule
angular.module('myModule', ['dependencies1', 'dependencies2']);

// Retrieve previously created module
angular.module('myModule');

// Create module without dependencies
angular.module('otherModule', []);
</pre>

<p>
  Angular modules are also helpful in unit tests to only load the modules needed for the test.
</p>

<pre class="code-example">
describe('myModule tests', function() {
  // Load myModule module for testing
  beforeEach(module('myModule'));
});
</pre>

<jslab-tip>
For each Angular application, you should create an application-level module that handles global dependencies. The application should be then be structured using a feature or pod structure where each feature of the app has its own folder and module. The modules should be namespaced under a common global name for your application. Additionally, each reusable component of the app, such as directives and services, should also have their own modules.

<jslab-tip>
Each file should contain a single component and should be named according to a common naming pattern, such as module-type.js. For example, the controller in the home module should be named home-controller.js. Unit test files should be placed along the source code with -test appended to the file name, such as home-controller-test.js. All file names should be lower cased, dasherized and descriptive.
